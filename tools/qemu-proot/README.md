# Local QEMU/PRoot tool image

This Docker build context supplies the implementation behind
`scripts/run-qemu-proot-runtime.sh`.

The PRoot executable is built from the exact clean Termux PRoot tag underlying
the Acurast Processor 1.27.0-rc1 APK readback:

- source: `termux/proot` commit `58aad2cb1c36ea6af7b32d76ccd5bf8d0a967939`
- tag: `v5.1.107.72`
- source archive SHA-256:
  `0e132e306214adba900479d3262058f179577856f375d786d3e062498ca957fd`
- Android ashmem UAPI compatibility header: generated Android-L header from
  AOSP commit `797351fd3bbb8fe517afafdd5095fd740387e7a4`, SHA-256
  `1806e49478167732a5511c87a229b5ff1df4bc4d26fbaf5282df313dab0df974`;
  the build prepends Debian's required `linux/types.h` include
- host compiler/linker: Debian Bookworm Clang + LLD (the revision's embedded
  loader requires LLD's `--rosegment` option)
- license: GPL-2.0-or-later; copied into the local tool image at
  `/usr/share/licenses/termux-proot/COPYING`

The APK binary identifies itself as `v5.1.107.72-dirty` and additionally owns
an Acurast-specific outbound-connect interceptor. That dirty patch is not
present in public Termux PRoot and is not reconstructed here. This tool matches
the public base version and command-line extensions, then exposes explicit
local fault profiles without claiming to reproduce the Android-only patch.

`scripts/smoke-qemu-proot.sh <release-helper> [static-lib-test-executable]`
keeps the release binary's version and missing-bridge refusal separate from
an offline source/ABI handoff proof. The optional executable is Cargo's existing
AArch64 library test binary, built from the same candidate source. Both emulator
profiles run the production supervisor setup and real diagnostic reporter with
offline Bridge/HTTP fixtures: an invalid inherited Android TMPDIR cannot redirect
helper storage, the real child writes an advertisement through the supplied
private paths, and canonical request bytes reach the signing seam. The direct
custody tests also exercise parent/leaf replacement, refusal, restart, and
cleanup. This fixture is test-only; it adds no release-helper bootstrap bypass
and does not prove real bridge cryptography, Acurast connectivity, or peer sync.

The tool image also builds static AArch64 linux-user QEMU 9.2.0 from the
upstream release archive, SHA-256
`f859f0bc65e1f533d040bbe8c92bcfecee5af2c921a6687c652fb44d089bd894`.
Its detached archive signature was verified with the release-manager key
`CEACC9E15534EBABB82D3FA03353C9CEF108B584`, named by qemu.org/download.
Bookworm QEMU 7.2 returns EINVAL for the supervisor's existing
PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER/PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER calls; upstream 9.2 implements
both. This emulator companion lets the offline fixture exercise the real
process authority and child handoff. It does not change the deployed helper's
syscall policy, the PRoot base, the pinned guest image, or the fault profiles.
